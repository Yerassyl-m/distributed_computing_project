Created a functionality to determine the location within 50 km. Using Django as a backend, I developed an algorithm that finds the shortest path between two points. Using Docker, I made it possible to run on different operating systems. Using Docker Compose I configuredrunning multiple servers at the same time. Nginx was used to reduce load on servers when opening.
